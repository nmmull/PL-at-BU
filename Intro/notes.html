When we write a program in our favorite programming language<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> we fill a file with a
bunch of symbols and text.  This is one of the beauties of
programming: looking past the bells and whistles provided by editors
and IDEs, a program is just a stream of characters.
</p>

<p>
At some point in our programming workflow (hopefully not the very end)
we want to verify that what we've written thus far actually works, so
we <i>run</i> our program.  In some IDEs, this literally means pressing a
play button.  For more down-to-earth setups, this might mean opening
up a terminal and typing out a few commands.
</p>

<p>
In either case, we are running a <i>different</i> program in order to run
the program we've written (huh).  Our goal is to understand what's
going on here. <i>What is this program doing? How does it do it? What
sorts of data structures does this program use?</i> etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
Our intuition should probably tell us this program is doing something
fairly complicated.  Just imagine how hard it is for us as humans
(and, more specifically, students) to follow directions.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
So, our basic question is: <i>How do we get from that stream of symbols
to the <b>output</b> of our program?</i>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb63ec93" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb63ec93">Interpretation vs. Compilation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb63ec93">
<p>
We start by making a loose but ultimately important distinction, that
of <b>interpretation</b> versus <b>compilation</b>.  At the risk of
oversimplifying, we will use the following definitions to distinguish
between these two processes.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Interpretation</b> is the process of taking a source program and
its input, and then running it immediately to get its output.</li>
<li><b>Compilation</b> is the process of taking a source program in a
high-level language and then <i>translating it</i> into a program in a
low-level language which can be given input and run separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These processes are often represented by the following (somewhat
unreasonably) simple diagrams.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Interpretation:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ascii">char stream ────►┌─────────────┐
                 │ INTERPRETER │────► output
      input ────►└─────────────┘
</pre>
</div></li>

<li><p>
Compilation:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ascii">                 ┌──────────┐
char stream ────►│ COMPILER │─╮
                 └──────────┘ │
          ╭─low-level program─╯
          │
          ╰─────►┌──────────┐
                 │  TARGET  │───► output
      input ────►└──────────┘
</pre>
</div></li>
</ul>

<p>
Again, this is a loose distinction. There may be intermediate
translations in the process of interpretation (this is what OCaml
does).  We'll look briefly at compilation but we'll focus
primarily on interpretation.
</p>

So, <i>what's happening inside an interpreter?</i> We start with a diagram.
We can think of this image as providing a window into the
<code>INTERPRETER</code> box above.

<p>
There's a lot to parse here (pun intended), but this also gives us an outline
of what is to come:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first two boxes turn a stream of characters we've typed up into
something that we can evaluate, i.e., that we can "run".  This part
of interpretation is about the <i>form</i> (or <i>syntax</i>) of the program.
We will use <b>formal grammars</b> to represent this form mathematically
and we will use <b>parser generators</b> to set up the code for these two
boxes.  Just like natural language, programming languages are
hierarchical, and making that heirarchical structure explicit will
make it easier to evaluate.</li>

<li>The next box is where we do <b>type checking</b> and/or <b>type inference</b>.
It's during this part of the pipeline that we verify if the
programming we're planning on evaluating actually makes sense.  If
it does, then we can pass it onto the evaluator, perhaps in a
simpler form called an <b>abstract syntax tree (AST)</b> or occassionally
some other <b>intermediate reprentation (IR)</b>.</li>

<li>The last box actually runs our program to get its output, its
<i>value</i>.  This part of interpetation is about the <i>meaning</i> (or
<i>semantics</i>) of the program.  We use <b>formal semantics</b> to
describe what it means to give a program this meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orge920708">What's Next</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge920708">
<p>
Programming languages is one of these topics that has incredibly
deep implications both in theory and in practice.  It will be important
to us not just to think about how to implement an interpreter, but
also about the underlying logical frameworks we need for programming
languages to make sense.
</p>

<p>
So there will be a frequent give-and-take here between theory and
practice.  Be prepared to do handwritten work (not quite proofs, but
something akin to them) as well as programming (i.e., building the
components interpreter).
</p>

<p>
We begin with the study of <a href="file:///Users/NathanM/Developer/Repositories/nmmull.github.io/PL-at-BU/Formal-Grammar/notes.html">Formal Grammar</a>, the basis of parsing
(and also of theoretical linguistics).
